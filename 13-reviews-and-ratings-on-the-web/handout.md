# Reviews and ratings on the web

## Introduction

[User-generated content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content) is one of the cornerstones of the world wide web. It touches as diverse areas as problem solving, news, research and comes in a variety of forms such as blogs, discussion forums, social media, wikis, crowd funding, and of course *reviews*. The latter is applied to geospatial metadata during the Geosoftware II seminar in 2014/15. This handout lists related research, websites and provides some ideas for discussion.

## Legal perspective

As often with new and exciting technology and possibilities one forgets about laws and regulations that have an impact on review sites on the web. Especially copyright law applies here, including its challenges with respect to global differences in copyright regulations. For the study project, we don't encounter these issues to the full extend, since we will work in a controlled environment (university access only). Therefore we will skip the creation of user agreements etc. With respect to German law, liability starts for the platform operator at the moment that he is made aware of a violation of any law. Such a "report" button could be part of a GeoComment implementation, as could be a content filter.

The following links give some background information and are a starting point for further research:

  * "Revyu.com is a web site where you can review and rate things. Unlike many other reviewing sites on the web, Revyu.com lets you review and rate absolutely anything you can name."
  * Provices a SPARQL endpoint: http://revyu.com/sparql/welcome
  * Does not allow new users mode since end of 2009](http://blog.revyu.com/2009/12/21/taking-a-break-from-the-spammers/), but certainly was an inspiration for the seminar topic.
